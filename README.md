### 9. Test the Game

1. In Slack, type `/glitter` in any channel where the bot is present

## Game Rules

- Each game has a 3√ó3 grid of tiles covered with üüß‚ú®
- Only one tile contains the prize (üéÅ)
- Other tiles reveal misses (üß°)
- Winners get a celebratory modal with a discount code
- By default, each user can only win once (configurable via `ONE_WIN_PER_USER`)

## Optional: Shopify Integration

To generate real discount codes instead of stubbed ones, add these to your `.env`:

```
SHOPIFY_STORE=your-store.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_ADMIN_TOKEN=shpat_your-admin-token
SHOPIFY_API_VERSION=2023-10
DISCOUNT_PREFIX=GLITTER
DISCOUNT_PERCENT=20
```

### Getting Shopify Admin Token

1. In your Shopify admin, go to Apps ‚Üí "Manage private apps" (or "App and sales channel settings")
2. Create a private app with these permissions:
   - Discounts: Read and write
3. Copy the Admin API access token

## Architecture Notes

- Game state is stored in memory (Map) for simplicity
- For production, replace with Redis or database (see comments in `app.js`)
- Uses Slack Socket Mode to avoid needing public URLs
- One game instance per user, resets on new `/glitter` command
